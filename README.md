# On Graphs And Models

## Abstract

This is an essay about graphs like and and models.
The main question is how to bring together __Resource Description Framework (RDF)__ and __Property Graphs (PG)__.
The bridge is not a technical thing like _RDF*_.
The main difference between RDF and PG lies deeper in a basic decision how to do modelling.

With this essay I want to investigate this modelling styles.
The conclusions are the foundation for a generalized view on graphs and modelling which in in turn
is the basis for technical solutions that harmonize RDF and PGs.
